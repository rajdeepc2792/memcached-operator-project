# Demo Operator(Memcached Operator)

This project is dedicated to learning of components required to setup a Kubernetes Operator from Initialisation step to Deployment step via Tekton Pipeline and Operator Lifecycle Manager.

Additionally, We also plan to discuss existing pipeline setup around RH GitHub projects which can also be used for configuring CICD pipelines around non-RH projects.

## Contents

I plan to break the learning into 5 parts(Last 2 parts deal with RH Internal pipeline configurations):-

1. [Operator Initialisation and Setup. (In Progress)]
2. [Operator Lifecycle Manager setup for Demo Operator. (In Progress)]
3. [CICD Pipeline using Tekton setup for Operator Image and Catalog update. (In Progress)]
4. [App-Interface's CICD pipeline setup for RH Operator/Project. (In Progress)]
5. [Prow CI pipeline setup in openshift/release repo for RH projects. (In Progress)]
